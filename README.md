LunaGeek is a community-oriented brand that empowers women and girls to pursue a tech career.

So far, my responsibilities included branding, designing, and developing Redux ecommerce site.

I've utilized React.js, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Authentication, and PayPal payment integration.

I have bigger plans for the site, but I am taking step by step approach, and I will implement more functionalities in the future.
